# Unit Testing Overview

Unit testing is a fundamental aspect of modern software development practices, serving several crucial purposes:

* **Verifying Business Logic Behavior**: It ensures that the business logic of the application functions correctly as intended.

* **Protection from Unnoticed Breaking Changes**: By regularly running unit tests, developers can detect and address potential issues, preventing the introduction of unnoticed breaking changes in the future.

* **Facilitating Refactoring**: Unit tests can be used to verify that the code still works as expected after refactoring.

* **Improving Code Quality**:   


By adopting a robust unit testing approach, developers can have greater confidence in the reliability and stability of their code, contributing to the overall quality of the software.
