# Integration Testing Overview
Integration testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the interactions between different components or modules of a software application. Its purpose is to ensure that individual units work together correctly when integrated, and to identify any issues that may arise at the interface points.

In C#, integration testing can involve testing the interactions between various classes, modules, or services to verify their collective functionality. This testing is typically done after unit testing and before system testing to ensure that the integrated parts work cohesively.

Example of Integration Testing in C#:

Let's consider a simple example of an e-commerce application with two classes: OrderProcessor and PaymentGateway. The OrderProcessor class is responsible for handling order processing, and it interacts with the PaymentGateway class to process payments.

Integration Test Scenario:

1. Test whether the OrderProcessor correctly interacts with the PaymentGateway to process payments and update the order status accordingly.


Example of Integration Test in C# using MSTest:
```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

[TestClass]
public class OrderProcessorIntegrationTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void ProcessOrder_Should_UpdateOrderStatus_When_PaymentIsSuccessful()
    {
        // Arrange
        var orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor();
        var paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway();

        // Assume an order with a specific status (e.g., "Pending")
        var order = new Order { Status = "Pending" };

        // Act
        var paymentResult = paymentGateway.ProcessPayment(order, 100.0);

        // Assert
        Assert.IsTrue(paymentResult); // Assuming payment is successful
        Assert.AreEqual("Paid", order.Status); // Check if the order status is updated to "Paid" after successful payment
    }
}
```
In this example, the integration test verifies whether the OrderProcessor correctly interacts with the PaymentGateway to process the payment and update the order status. The test creates instances of the OrderProcessor and PaymentGateway classes, simulates the payment process, and then checks if the order status is updated to "Paid" as expected.

Integration testing in C# is crucial as it helps identify potential issues arising from the integration of different components and ensures that the software application functions smoothly as a whole.
