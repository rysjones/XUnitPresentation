- What is unit testing / integration testing? what are the benefits?

## Code Samples
- Code samples from Sign services on how to unit test code with SF.

## Follow-up tasks
- Schedule recurrent meeting.
- Start with making presentations about the code theory, use chatgpt to speed up the process.
- On next meeting maybe discuss sending the meeting invitation + start with the code samples. We need to take into account the Dublin folks and their time zone.
