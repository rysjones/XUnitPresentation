# Applying Unit Tests in C# Code Using xUnit

### Introduction:
Welcome, everyone, to this presentation on how to apply unit tests in C# code using xUnit. Unit testing is a critical practice in modern software development that helps ensure the reliability, maintainability, and quality of our code. Today, we'll explore how to leverage xUnit, a popular testing framework for C#, to write effective and efficient unit tests.

Agenda:

1. Understanding Unit Testing
2. Introducing xUnit Testing Framework
3. Writing Your First xUnit Test
4. Organizing Test Classes and Methods
5. Test Data and Theories
6. Test Lifecycle and Setup/TearDown
7. Handling Exceptions in Tests
8. Mocking with xUnit
9. Running and Analyzing Test Results
10. Integration with Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline
